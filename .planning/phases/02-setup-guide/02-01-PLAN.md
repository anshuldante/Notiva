<objective>
Create a comprehensive setup guide that enables new developers to go from zero to running the Notiva app in under 15 minutes.

Purpose: This is the first actionable documentation a new developer encounters. A clear, accurate setup guide reduces onboarding friction and prevents abandonment due to confusing environment requirements.

Output: `docs/SETUP.md` with prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and troubleshooting guidance.

  <name>Task 1: Create comprehensive SETUP.md</name>
  <files>docs/SETUP.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/SETUP.md` with the following sections:

**1. Overview** (2-3 sentences)
- What this guide covers
- Estimated time: 10-15 minutes
- Link back to main README

**2. Prerequisites**
Document these exact requirements (derived from build.gradle and gradle-wrapper.properties):
- Android Studio: Ladybug (2024.2.x) or newer (required for Gradle 8.13 compatibility)
- Java Development Kit: JDK 17 (must match `JavaVersion.VERSION_17` in build.gradle)
- Android SDK: API 36 (compileSdk), Build Tools 36.0.0
- Device/Emulator: API 33+ (minSdkVersion 33)
- Git: For cloning the repository
- Disk space: ~2GB for SDK + ~500MB for project/dependencies

Include a prerequisites checklist with verification commands:
- `java -version` should show version 17
- Android Studio > Settings > Build > Gradle JDK should be 17

**3. Clone and Open**
Step-by-step:
1. Clone: `git clone <repository-url>` and `cd my-reminder-app`
2. Open Android Studio > "Open an existing project"
3. Select the project root directory
4. Wait for Gradle sync (first sync downloads dependencies, may take several minutes)

**4. Verify SDK Configuration**
- Android Studio > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Android SDK
- Ensure SDK Platforms has API 36 installed
- Ensure SDK Tools has Android SDK Build-Tools 36 installed
- Note about `local.properties` being auto-generated with SDK path

**5. Build the App**
Commands with explanations:
```bash
# Debug build (recommended for development)
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Run all checks (lint + tests + build)
./gradlew check

# Clean build (if encountering stale cache issues)
./gradlew clean assembleDebug
```
Expected output: `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` with APK at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

**6. Run the App**
Two methods:
- **Via Android Studio**: Click green "Run" button or Shift+F10
- **Via command line**: `./gradlew installDebug` (requires connected device/emulator)

Emulator setup note: Create AVD with API 33+ using AVD Manager

**7. Verify Installation**
- App appears as "Notiva" on device/emulator
- Main screen shows reminder list (may be empty on first run)
- Can tap FAB to create a new reminder

**8. Troubleshooting**
Common issues with solutions:

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Unsupported class file major version 61` | Wrong Java version | Set Gradle JDK to 17 in Android Studio settings |
| `SDK location not found` | Missing local.properties | Let Android Studio sync, or manually create with `sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/sdk` |
| `Failed to find Build Tools revision 36.0.0` | Missing build tools | Install via SDK Manager > SDK Tools |
| `Could not resolve com.google.dagger:hilt-android` | Network/repository issue | Check internet, try `./gradlew --refresh-dependencies` |
| Gradle sync hangs | First-time dependency download | Wait (can take 5-10 min on slow connections), check Android Studio progress bar |
| `minSdk 33` errors on older emulator | Emulator API too low | Create new AVD with API 33 or higher |
| Hilt compilation errors | Annotation processor issue | Clean and rebuild: `./gradlew clean assembleDebug` |

**9. Next Steps**
After successful setup, point to:
- [Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md) for understanding the codebase
- [README.md](README.md) for full documentation navigation

Format: Use proper markdown headers (##), code blocks with language hints, and tables for structured data. Include shell commands with comments explaining what they do.

  <verify>
1. File exists: `ls docs/SETUP.md`
2. Contains all required sections: `grep -E "^## " docs/SETUP.md` should show Prerequisites, Clone, Build, Run, Troubleshooting
3. Contains accurate version info: `grep "Java.*17" docs/SETUP.md` and `grep "API 36" docs/SETUP.md`
4. Links work: `grep -E "\[.*\]\(.*\.md\)" docs/SETUP.md` shows valid relative links
5. File is substantial: `wc -l docs/SETUP.md` shows 150+ lines
  </verify>
  <done>
- docs/SETUP.md exists with 150+ lines
- All 8 sections present (Overview through Next Steps)
- Prerequisites match actual build.gradle requirements (Java 17, SDK 36, Build Tools 36, minSdk 33)
- Troubleshooting table covers at least 5 common issues
- All relative links use correct paths (ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md)
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
Phase-level verification:
1. A new developer reading only SETUP.md has all information needed to run the app
2. Version numbers in documentation match actual build configuration
3. All commands shown are tested and work in the project directory
4. Troubleshooting covers the most likely failure modes
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- docs/SETUP.md exists and is comprehensive (150+ lines)
- Prerequisites section lists exact version requirements from build.gradle
- Clone/build/run steps are complete and actionable
- Troubleshooting table has 5+ common issues with solutions
- Documentation follows markdown best practices (proper headers, code blocks, tables)
- Phase 2 success criteria from ROADMAP.md are satisfied
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-setup-guide/02-01-SUMMARY.md` following the summary template.
