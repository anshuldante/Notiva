<objective>
Create the documentation hub (docs/README.md) that serves as the central entry point for all Notiva developer documentation.

Purpose: Enable developers landing in the docs/ folder to immediately understand what documentation exists and navigate to the specific doc they need.

Output: A complete docs/README.md with project overview, badges, and navigation table linking to all planned documentation.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create docs folder structure</name>
  <files>docs/</files>
  <action>
Create the docs/ directory in the repository root if it does not exist.

This establishes the conventional location for developer documentation.
  </action>
  <verify>Directory exists: `ls -d docs/`</verify>
  <done>docs/ folder exists at repository root</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create documentation hub README</name>
  <files>docs/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create docs/README.md with the following structure:

1. **Title and Badges**
   - Title: "Notiva Developer Documentation"
   - Build status badge (placeholder for GitHub Actions if not set up): `![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)`
   - License badge: Check if LICENSE file exists at repo root. If yes, use appropriate badge. If no, use `![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-proprietary-lightgrey)`

2. **Project Overview** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What Notiva is: Android reminder app
   - Tech stack summary: Java, Room, Hilt, WorkManager, Material Design
   - What these docs cover: Architecture, setup, features, testing, contributing

3. **Quick Start**
   - Link to SETUP.md for environment setup
   - Brief "clone, build, run" commands (details in SETUP.md)

4. **Navigation Table** with "I want to..." format:

| I want to... | Go to |
|--------------|-------|
| Set up my development environment | [Setup Guide](SETUP.md) |
| Understand the app architecture | [Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Learn about the database schema | [Database Reference](DATABASE.md) |
| Run or write tests | [Testing Guide](TESTING.md) |
| Understand how reminders work | [Reminders Feature](features/REMINDERS.md) |
| Understand notifications | [Notifications Feature](features/NOTIFICATIONS.md) |
| Learn about recurrence logic | [Recurrence & Constraints](features/RECURRENCE.md) |
| See the UI structure | [UI Documentation](UI.md) |
| Contribute to the project | [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) |

5. **Documentation Status**
   - Table showing which docs exist vs planned
   - This helps developers know what's available now

6. **App Package Info**
   - Package: `com.ava.notiva`
   - Key entry points: MainActivity, UpsertReminderActivity

Note: Links point to files that don't exist yet - this is intentional. Future phases will create these files.
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists: `ls docs/README.md`
- Contains badges: `grep -q "img.shields.io" docs/README.md`
- Contains navigation table: `grep -q "I want to" docs/README.md`
- Contains all planned doc links: `grep -c "\.md" docs/README.md` returns at least 9
  </verify>
  <done>
- docs/README.md exists with 50+ lines
- Has project overview section
- Has build status and license badges
- Has "I want to..." navigation table
- Links to all 9 planned documentation files
- Developer can scan the page and find any doc in under 10 seconds
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing both tasks:

1. Structural verification:
   - `ls docs/README.md` succeeds
   - `wc -l docs/README.md` shows 50+ lines

2. Content verification:
   - `grep "Notiva" docs/README.md` finds project name
   - `grep "img.shields.io" docs/README.md` finds badges
   - `grep "I want to" docs/README.md` finds navigation header
   - `grep "SETUP.md" docs/README.md` finds setup link
   - `grep "ARCHITECTURE.md" docs/README.md` finds architecture link
   - `grep "features/REMINDERS.md" docs/README.md` finds feature docs

3. Markdown validity:
   - No syntax errors when rendered (tables render correctly)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 1 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:

1. [x] docs/README.md exists with clear project overview
2. [x] README contains "I want to..." navigation table linking to all planned docs
3. [x] README displays badges for build status and license
4. [x] Developer landing on docs/ immediately knows what docs exist and where to find them

All four criteria are satisfied when:
- The file exists at docs/README.md
- It contains the badges, overview, and complete navigation table
- A developer can open docs/README.md and within 10 seconds know how to find any doc
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-documentation-hub/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
