# Milestone v1.0: Developer Documentation

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-05
**Phases:** 1-10
**Total Plans:** 10

## Overview

This roadmap delivers comprehensive developer documentation for the Notiva Android reminder app. The journey progresses from establishing the documentation foundation (README, setup, architecture) through reference materials (database, testing) to feature documentation (reminders, notifications, recurrence) and culminates with UI documentation and contribution guidelines. Each phase builds on previous work, establishing vocabulary and mental models that later phases reference.
